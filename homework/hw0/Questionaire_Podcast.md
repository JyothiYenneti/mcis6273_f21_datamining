# Question 1 List three things that you learned from this podcast?

Listening to the podcast I have learned many things and also got complete insight on how to start with data science.

Below are a few things that I have learned from the podcast:

1.	We should code as much as we can to gain hands on experience. Start working on things first and make progress gradually.
2.	Try and figure out smaller experiments rather than larger one.
3.	Use smaller data sets initially to gain accuracy.
4.  Get hold of one framework and then start working on another.
5.  How to present ourselves at the interview.


# Question 2 what is your reaction to podcast? Pick at least one-point Sanyam bought up in the interview that you agree with and list your reason why?


I feel completely happy and knowledgeable on how to start my career in data science and excel myself in that career.

Sanyam Bhutani has brought up many points on how to start career in data science. Some of them were:

1. Participating in Kaggle competitions
2. Start with Fast.ai

I completely accept his idea of participating in Kaggle competitions because, initially I have done many certifications, but I have not gained total real-time hands-on experience and I didnâ€™t have the confidence that I can take up a project. So instead of spending time on watching videos for hours together I would rather select taking up a project and working on it step by step which would help me think about it, and apply the necessary technique required.
So, in a nutshell participating in Kaggle competitions brings up motivation in us, allows us to choose the project we are interested in and work on it so that we can gain confidence and also, we can show/talk about our approach in the interviews.





# Question 3 After listening to the podcast, do you think you are more interested or less interested in a career in data science?


I have started my data science learning earlier in this year, but I was not clear on how to proceed or what is required to grow in this career.

After listening to the podcast, I have gained confidence, motivation and also guidance on how and where to start my career for data science.

Now I am very much interested in a career in data science, and I would like to really work hard for it by following all the guidance provided by Sanyam Bhutani.

I would also thank my professor Maull Keith for giving me an opportunity to listen to this podcast and guiding me in the right path to become a successful data scientist.
